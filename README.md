# UserLoginTemplate

-> On login the user is redirected to either of the two paths depending upon user type.
-> I have used "superuser" and "user" to seperate these two users.
-> "superuser" will be redirected to admin dashboard whereas "user" will be redirected to staff dashboard.

SuperUser:
	username : preet
	password : preet
User:
	username : Yash
	password : preet12345

-> new superuser or user can be created using shell to further test this
